=begin 

I like API Dock best for two main reasons:
* The url links directly to the method instead of the class
(no need to scroll down to find your method)
* There is a possibility to leave a comment, and some people have 
left very interesting suggestions regarding how to use a method.

However, when I find the explanations about a method somewhat
cloudy, I double check with Ruby Doc, to be sure I've fully 
understood the method.
